# HopCoP
A theorem prover for first-order logic based on connection tableaux and backjumping.

## Build
Install a Rust toolchain: [rustup](https://rustup.rs) is convenient for this.

```
$ cargo build --release
```

There should now be an executable at `target/release/hopcop`.

## Usage
```
$ hopcop --help
```
